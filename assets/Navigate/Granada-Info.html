        <p>Granada, is the city of Alhambra, one of the important monuments which you should visit during your vacation
          in Spain. Granada is located near to Sierra Nevada mountains (snowing snow covered mountains) in southern
          Spain.
          With four rivers surrounding it: Darro, Genil, Monachil and Beiro. The most known rivers are Darro and Genil,
          where their confluence point is situated in the Roman Bridge. Granada has a height of 783 meters above sea
          level, which takes one hour approximately by car to reach the Mediterranean coast known as Costa Tropical.
          Firstly, Arabs were installedsettled in the Elvira mountains (near Atarfe) and other mountains named Gharnata
          which had a mainly Jewish Population so it was known as Gharnata al-Yahud. The population of Granada (Syrian
          population) played an important role supporting the prince Abed Rahman I, founder of the Emirate of Cordoba
          under the Umayyad dynasty.
          The splendor or of the region began in the 11th century during the Zirid Taifa of Granada (derived for a north
          African Berber tribe called Sanhaja who ruled a part in North Africa). The domination of Zirid took place in
          the civil war of Al-Andalus (fitna) whose leader was Zawi Benben Ziri.
          Some of the construction historic structures left until our days of from that period was the Old citadel in
          addition to their palace known as al- Qasaba al-Qadima in the Albaicin neighborhood.
          The Almoravids and Almohads ruled the city leaving Alcazar Genil (Genil Palace) as one of the artistic
          monuments which was later redecorated by the Nasrid rule.
          In the 13th century, Almohads left the city to become the capital of the Nasrid Kingdom which ruled over
          Granada, Malaga and Almeria. In that period, a great number of monuments were constructed reflecting an
          incomparable beauty until our days. The most significant monument of that period was the Alhambra, an Arabic
          Islamic architecture and one of the most visited historical sites in Spain.
          The Alhambra is more than a Palace. It is a castle, a fortress, a town, gardens for summer retreat. Alhambra
          Palace is a Palatine city in itself.
          The Christians took power over Granada in 1492 and progressively the city's architectural style was
          transformed into a Christian one.
          The 16th century showed a Mudejar, Renaissance and Baroque flourished style regarding architecture and
          different
          features of the city.
          So many constructions were demolished between 1810 – 1812 due to the French Napoleon's army, in addition to
          the
          Spanish Civil war which ended in 1936. Recently, Granada has shown a high number of visitors due to its
          history
          and Alhambra citadel which is known as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. </p>
